# MotorController

This project was built for a *Mechatronics* Paper. It implements a motor controller using a PIC microcontroller, where the user can set a speed and the system does its best to keep to that speed using PI control. Feedback utilizes the back EMF of the motor. The project contains both the code and the circuit schematics, along with a report.
